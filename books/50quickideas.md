# Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories

#### Tell Stories, dont write them 
Requirements by collaboration. Use physical story cards, electronic ticketing systems and backlog management tools as remainders for conversations, don´t waste too much time nailing down the details upfront.

#### Don´t worrt too much about story format
The key element :
- Story card is ideally just a token for a conversation.

Prefered ` 'As a .. I want .. So that..' ` Write down who wants something and why.
 
 - Name Stories early, add details later.
 - Avoid spelling out obvious solutions.
 - Thinkg about more than one stakeholder who would be interested in the item.
 - Use a picture instead words
 - Ask a question
 - Focus on the problem statement
 
#### Describe a behaviour change
Valuable initiatives produce observable change in someone´s way of working.Identify what could change in the system that produces a change in the user´s way interaction as an example.A measurable behaviour change make stories easier to split.

#### Describe the system change
Every story should describe behavoiur change that represent business value (the why) of the story, it should also be clear about the change a team needs to make to software(what)
 
#### Approach storias as survivable experiments
Stories should be about how much business stakeholders want to invest in learning whether a proposed change will actually give them what they assumed. Help business sponsors manage their investment in software and get the most out of it. 
If a story is too big, which effectively means the potentional cost of the experiment is too high, we can look at alternative ways of learning about something instead just trying to slice the story.

#### Watch out for generic roles
A generic user role can never provide a particular user segment, it impossible to decide whether the proposed solution is the right one, or if it´s just unnecessary scope creep.(Consider how the product will be used as narrow target group)

#### Evaluate zone of control and sphere of influence
