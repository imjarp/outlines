# Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories

## Creating stories

#### Tell Stories, dont write them 
Requirements by collaboration. Use physical story cards, electronic ticketing systems and backlog management tools as remainders for conversations, don´t waste too much time nailing down the details upfront.

#### Don´t worry too much about story format
The key element :
- Story card is ideally just a token for a conversation.

Prefered ` 'As a .. I want .. So that..' ` Write down who wants something and why.
 
 - Name Stories early, add details later.
 - Avoid spelling out obvious solutions.
 - Thinkg about more than one stakeholder who would be interested in the item.
 - Use a picture instead words
 - Ask a question
 - Focus on the problem statement
 
#### Describe a behaviour change
Valuable initiatives produce observable change in someone´s way of working.Identify what could change in the system that produces a change in the user´s way interaction as an example.A measurable behaviour change make stories easier to split.

#### Describe the system change
Every story should describe behavoiur change that represent business value (the why) of the story, it should also be clear about the change a team needs to make to software(what)
 
#### Approach storias as survivable experiments
Stories should be about how much business stakeholders want to invest in learning whether a proposed change will actually give them what they assumed. Help business sponsors manage their investment in software and get the most out of it. 
If a story is too big, which effectively means the potentional cost of the experiment is too high, we can look at alternative ways of learning about something instead just trying to slice the story.

#### Watch out for generic roles
A generic user role can never provide a particular user segment, it impossible to decide whether the proposed solution is the right one, or if it´s just unnecessary scope creep.(Consider how the product will be used as narrow target group)

#### Evaluate zone of control and sphere of influence
- _The zone of control_ includes all those things in a system that we can change on our own.
- _The sphere of influence_ includes activities that we can impact, but can’t exercise full control over.
- _The external environment_ includes the elements over which we have no influence.

A good guideline is that the user need of a story (‘In order to…’) should ideally be in the sphere of influence of the delivery team, and the deliverable (‘I want…’) should ideally be in their zone of control

#### Put a 'best before ' date on stories
Separate user stories from the rest of the back log if they have time constraints and put ir a best before date to calculate when you should start working on, so they wont get "expired".

## Planning with stories

#### Set deadlines for addressing major risks
Delivery teams should work with stakeholders to set explicit deadlines for addressing major risks at sustainable pace ( FBI example). Having an explicit plan to deal with big risks allows stakeholders and the delivery team to strike the right balance bewteen short-term business win and long term sustainability.

#### Use hierarchical backlogs
Try to divide your plan int several tiers and ther avoid breaking donw a higher-level until you complete all the relevant lower-level stories for the previous higher-level item.

Recommended levels:
 - big-picture business objective : example grow mobile suscription
 - smaller scale business change that might contribute to that big picture : better conversion from web to mobile
 - software deliverables that support those changes : data import from competitor formats
 - smaller delirevable slickes that we could ship independently: file access to competitor systems
 
Having an hierarchical backlog you could move toward a differente business objective if the market could change(has differents objectives).

#### Group storis by impact

Impact map ( mind map ) is a visaulisation of how delirevable scopes connects to business goals and the underlying assumptions on four levels.

The first level of the mind map is the business goal for a milestone of a project or a product delivery. The second level of the mind map contains user segments, stakeholders or actors who will be involved in achieving the goal. The third level of the map shows the impacts on users and stakeholders that can contribute to the business goal, or that could hinder achieving the objective. The fourth level of the map is for the deliverables – user stories or even larger deliverables (such as epics) that can cause the impacts.

| Goal    | Actor                 | Impact  | Deliverable |
|-------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Grow 	  | ->Super fan	       -> | ->Come back freq-> | ->Push Updates    |
| Mobile  | ->Concert Organizers  | ->Stay Longer      | ->Speacial Offers | 
| Adv     | -> Artists            | ->View more ads    |                   |
